# TSA-Webmaster-2026
Project for the TSA Webmaster competition.

Our project follows the theme by making a community website for a fictional city taking place in the future. (heavily inspired by star wars)

## TODO:
- [ ] Rename the planet, and get rid of other copyrighted things
- [ ] Implement database and form support
- [ ] Stylize events
- [ ] Proper light/dark theme support
- [ ] Experiment with other styling

## Theme:
>Create a website that will serve as a community resource hub to highlight resources available to residents within the community (e.g., non-profits, support services, community events and programs, etc.). Your entry for this event is an exception to the general rules for the 2026 National TSA Conference regarding identifying information and you may include school or chapter name if it is the same name as the community used.
> Your website should include the following: 
> * an interactive directory of community resources (resource hub) that allows users to search and filter the resources. 
> * a highlight section that spotlights at least three of the community resources you have listed in your resource hub. 
> * a form that users can submit to indicate new resources that should be added to the community resources hub. 
> * additional content to enhance the community resource hub for end users.
